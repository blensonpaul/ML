These are my Machine learning codes developed for Energy Research and Other Applications (Financial, Biology etc)

1) excel_python_v3_final.ipynb 
This code transforms the battery cycling data from a time series (large set of V,I values over every second) into a Voltage - AmpSecond domain (or Voltage Capacity ) domain data. This , I think is very usefull for battery testing research.
